	Instead, use `flwr.client.start_client()` by ensuring you first call the `.to_client()` method as shown below:
	flwr.client.start_client(

		client=FlowerClient().to_client(), # <-- where FlowerClient is of type flwr.client.NumPyClient object

	Using `start_numpy_client()` is deprecated.

            This is a deprecated feature. It will be removed
            entirely in future versions of Flower.
